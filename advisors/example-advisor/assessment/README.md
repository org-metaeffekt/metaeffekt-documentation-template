# Vulnerability Assessment

The `assessment` folder container yaml files that contain context-specific assessment information.

The example uses an assessment of CVE-2021-44228 (here as an applicable vulnerability) and CVE-2021-45046 as 
vulnerability that is not applicable, because the affected MDC feature is not used in this context.

The example is artifical and meant to illustrate the different options for vulnerability assessment.
