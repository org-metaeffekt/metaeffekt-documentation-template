        rationale:
          "<p>
              The application services are operated in an isolated network. No direct access from the external adversaries
              shall be possible.
          </p>
          <p>
              The CVSS vectors have been adjusted to expect that an adversary must have access to the network the 
              application service are deployed (MAV:A; AV:A). Additional privileges are required (MAC:H) as the adversary 
              must have already passed the gateway-level security perimeter or the physical protection of the data center.
