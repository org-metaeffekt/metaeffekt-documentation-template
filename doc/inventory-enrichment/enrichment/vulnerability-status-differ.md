# Inventory Vulnerability Status differ

The `com.metaeffekt.artifact.analysis` : `ae-inventory-enrichment-plugin` : `vulnerability-differ` goal allows for
comparing two sets of one or more inventories with each other. Currently, the only comparing attribute is the
vulnerability status.

## Example configuration

```xml
<configuration>
    <referenceInventories1>
        <file>/Users/.../inventory-enriched-1.xls</file>
    </referenceInventories1>
    <referenceInventories2>
        <file>/Users/.../inventory-enriched-2.xls</file>
    </referenceInventories2>

    <outputInventoryDiff1to2>
        /Users/.../1-2.xls
    </outputInventoryDiff1to2>
    <outputInventoryDiff2to1>
        /Users/.../2-1.xls
    </outputInventoryDiff2to1>
</configuration>
```

## Explanation

The following is a high-level description of the differ process:

1. Parse all inventories from the files provided into two lists
2. Merge the lists into one inventory each, only keeping the `Vulnerabilities` sheet
3. For diff 1 --> 2 and for diff 2 --> 1:
    1. Build a superset of all vulnerability identifiers from both merged inventories
    2. Iterate all vulnerability identifiers:
        1. Find a vulnerability with the exact identifier in both inventories, if available
        2. Parse the `Status` from both vulnerabilities, if available
        3. Build a combined vulnerability that contains the identifier, old and new status and the status change label (
           see
           below for more information)
    3. Create a new inventory from the combined vulnerabilities and write it to the out file

The status change label is determined using the following logic:

- if the vulnerability is not contained in any of the inventories, the process fails
- if the vulnerability is only in the first inventory, use `Removed (expected void)` if the vulnerability has no status
  and `Removed` if the vulnerability has a status
- if the vulnerability is only in the second inventory, use `New`
- if the vulnerability is in both inventories, use the following table:

| v after \ before -> | applicable   | not applicable | insignificant | void       | null      |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| applicable          | No Change    | Downrated      | Downrated     | Void       | Invalid   |
| not applicable      | Uprated      | No Change      | Downrated     | Void       | Invalid   |
| insignificant       | Uprated      | Uprated        | No Change     | Void       | Invalid   |
| void                | Reintroduced | Reintroduced   | Reintroduced  | No Change  | Invalid   |
| null                | Introduced   | Introduced     | Introduced    | Introduced | No Change |

The status column may not be empty, which is why `N/A` is used when the vulnerability does not exist in the inventory
and `in review` is used when the vulnerability exists.
